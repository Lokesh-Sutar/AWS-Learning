# S3
- Object level storage
- One of the important and cost effective service
- It stores different types of data like Photos, Audio, and Videos as Objects.

## Types of S3 Entities

### 1. Bucket
- A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3
- Is like main folder were you can upload your files and folders (Objects).
- You can create 100 Buckets per account.
- All the data stored inside the bucket is **Encrypted**
- Bucket should be empty before deleting the bucket.

#### Rules for Bucket Creation-
- Bucket names must be globally unique across all of AWS. No two buckets can have the same name.
- Must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
- Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and periods (.), **No Uppercase letters**.
- Must start and end with a lowercase letter or number.
- Should not be formatted as IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- A bucket has no limit to the amount of objects that it can store.
- No bucket can exist inside of other buckets.
- You can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS cloud accounts, with no limit on the number of objects you can store in a bucket.


### 2. Object
- Every entities (files & folders) are called objects
- Maximum size of each object is 5TB
- No limitation on number of objects to upload

### 3. Key
- A key is a unique identifier for an object.
- It is basically a path to locate the object.
- Every object in a bucket is associated with one key.
- eg. `key:Bucket123/folder1/file1.txt`


## Versioning in S3
- Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket
- It is like git version control system
- Every latest changes in file will become **current version**
- When you delete an object in a versioned bucket, S3 does not permanently remove the object. Instead, it creates a "delete marker" that becomes the current version. The actual object still exists and can be restored if needed by deleting the "delete marker" object.
- To delete the object permanently you have to enable "Show Versions" and then delete versions of file.

### Use Case
- To Store codes/repo
- To Host Website
- To Store Backups
